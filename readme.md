## Justin Irabor's Portfolio 2.0

Redid the second version of my portfolio. (See version 1.0 [here](https://vunderkind.github.io/))

To copy this portfolio, clone this repo and cd into the portfolio folder. do an `npm install` to load my dependencies, and you should be good to go. 

I'd appreciate some credit!
